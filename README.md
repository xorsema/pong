Pong
====

It's Pong! With paddles EVERYWHERE!
Visual Studio project included, but should build on Linux (or Mac OS X) just fine.

Limited netplay is supported.  No prediction or compensation of any kind is done, so over-the-internet play will probably suck.

Running the game with no commandline arguments starts a locally hosted game, with player 1 using the arrow keys and player 2 using A and D.
To host a game, use the argument "host".
To join a game, use the argument "join" followed by a host/IP.
